# Titanic_Survive_analysis_Task2

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and patterns that influenced passenger survival. The key tasks include:

#Data Cleaning:# Handling missing values and data types.

Visualization: Creating informative plots (heatmaps, pairplots, countplots) using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore correlations and distributions.

Feature Understanding: Analyzing how features like Age, Fare, Sex, and Pclass affect survival rates.

Outlier Detection: Identifying potential outliers using boxplots.

The notebook provides a visual, step-by-step approach to understanding the Titanic dataset and sets a solid foundation for further predictive modeling or feature engineering.
